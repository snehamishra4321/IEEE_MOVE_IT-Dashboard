# IEEE_MOVE_IT-Dashboard
## Emergency Response Optimization System (EROS)

## Overview
EROS is a prototype tool developed as a Capstone Project in collaboration with the IEEE MOVE Global team and Texas A&M University. It enhances emergency response by predicting demand hotspots and dynamically routing response vehicles for efficient deployment during disasters.

## Key Features
* Predictive Demand Analysis: Uses real-time and historical data to forecast emergency service needs, ensuring timely resource deployment.
* Dynamic Vehicle Routing: Optimizes routes for emergency vehicles, reducing response times.
* Data Integration: Integrates 100+ GB of environmental, demographic, and traffic data for enhanced situational awareness.
* GIS-Based Simulation: Analyzes community vulnerability through spatial data to aid in resource planning.
* Interactive Dashboard: Displays real-time hotspots, vehicle locations, optimized routes, and data visualizations for better coordination.
